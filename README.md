# IDP_LLPS
This package contains functions to sort, clean and analyze:
1) Fungal Substrate Data
2) Proteomic Data for Intrinsic Disorder 
3) Phase Separation.
   
Currently, the functions only represent the substrate analysis. 
IDP and LLPs data and analysis functions will be added at a later date when research is complete.

NOTE: There is a sample data set in 3 locations now, if it is difficult to find:
1) In 'man' folder
2) Also, now in main branch, below README file.
3) Also, added to the 'LISFungalPackage' folder

-The sample data.csv is a small example of the data used for this analysis because data is being published and on-going.
-The data and code will be updated in the up coming months

Some Libraries used include:
-ggplot2
-tidyr
